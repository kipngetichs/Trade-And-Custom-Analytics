# Unlocking Nigeria's Trade Secrets: Boost Taxes and Trade in 2025!
# Trade And Custom Analytics

# Situation
Trade and customs are a goldmine for Nigeria, bringing in taxes to grow the country! Picture tons of goods arriving, filling stores, and creating jobs. In this project, we dive into how Nigeria collects tax from 43,660 shipments. We’ll uncover which companies bring these goods and how they help the economy.
# Task
As a data analyst, my role was to check how much tax we should collect and find ways to make trade better. I had to identify busy months, top products, and key importers to plan smarter and keep trade safe. I teamed up with my group for two weeks to complete this project. Our goal was to make trade fair and smooth for everyone.
# Action
I started by collecting data from the company, then cleaned it using SQL—I fixed duplicates and filled in missing gaps to make it tidy. Next, I analyzed the data with SQL to spot patterns like peak months and popular goods. Finally, I created a clear dashboard in Power BI, a great tool, to show trends.
