# Unlocking Nigeria's Trade Secrets: Boost Taxes and Trade in 2025!
# Trade And Custom Analytics

# Situation
Trade and customs are a goldmine for Nigeria, bringing in taxes to grow the country! Picture tons of goods arriving, filling stores, and creating jobs. In this project, we dive into how Nigeria collects tax from 43,660 shipments. We’ll uncover which companies bring these goods and how they help the economy.
# Task
As a data analyst, my role was to check how much tax we should collect and find ways to make trade better. I had to identify busy months, top products, and key importers to plan smarter and keep trade safe. I teamed up with my group for two weeks to complete this project. Our goal was to make trade fair and smooth for everyone.
# Action
I started by collecting data from the company, then cleaned it using SQL,I fixed duplicates and filled in missing gaps to make it tidy. Next, I analyzed the data with SQL to spot patterns like peak months and popular goods. Finally, I created a clear dashboard in Power BI, a great tool, to show trends. You can check out the dashboard preview below!

# Results
- Total Shipments: 43,660 shipments, worth 1.93 trillion Naira CIF, with 252.5 billion Naira in taxes collected.
- Top Supplier: China leads at 0.78 trillion Naira, but we rely on them a lot.
- Busy Months: Imports peak in January and July, with a dip in February.
- Top Products: Cereals (3,330 shipments) and chemicals (150.20 billion Naira) are the biggest imports.
- Top Importers: 59991 handles 3.25 million shipments; 69009 pays 29.52 billion Naira tax.
- Busiest Office: HM Cargo manages 22,220 transactions, using 3.3 million 20DV containers.
- Tax Issue: 10,999 shipments have FOB = CIF, meaning possible tax errors.
- Safety: Only 0.03% of imports are from risky countries—pretty safe!
# Recommendations
# Main Recommendations for Solving the Problem:
- Fix the 10,999 shipments with FOB = CIF to add missing shipping costs and collect the right tax (up to 144 million Naira more).
- Add more staff in January and July to handle busy times and avoid delays.
- Speed up customs in February to help businesses during slow months.
- Monitor big importers like 59991 and 69009 to ensure they pay fair taxes.
- Grow trade with India and Italy to rely less on China and reduce risks.
# Reflection
This project taught me how to work as a team, sharing tasks and ideas to meet our two-week deadline. I learned to ask the right questions from stakeholders, like what they need from the dashboard, which made our work more useful. Collaborating helped us solve problems faster, like spotting tax errors. I also improved my SQL and Power BI skills, making me ready for bigger projects!
